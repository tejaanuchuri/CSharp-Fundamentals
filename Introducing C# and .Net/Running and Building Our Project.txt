create a console dotnet application:

    1. dotnet new console
    2. dotnet run   // current dir has project
    3. dotnet run --project (path specified)
    4. dotnet restore  
        note: 
        1. (.NET, there is a package system known as NuGet)
        2. A package system allows my application to take advantage of features and functionality that are in other bits of code that other developers have writtern.
        3. what ever my application needs a feature that is in Nuget package then .Net Core recorded that needed package information in to "GradeBook.csproj". 
        4. once execute the dotnet restore command in cmd line interface then dotnet restore looking into GradeBook.csproj file if see any other dependencies needed then it's restored.
    5. dotnet build 
        1. firstly they complied source code translate into efficient binary code.
        2. The C# compiler can come along at all of the c# source code that is in single output file that is binary.
        3. The file that dotnet build produces is this file GradeBook.dll
            note: 
            1. DLL means Dynamic Link Library called as assembly.
            2. Assembly is the output of the c# compiler or the VB.
        4. Once run the dotnet build bin floder was created.
        5. GradeBook.dll is Inside the bin folder.
        6. it is easy to debug having GradeBook.dll.
        7. Another folder obj and this folder contains only temporary files for during the restore and build process.
